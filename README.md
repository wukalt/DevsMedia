# Devs Media
a learning platform for developers 

**Using** : ASP.NET Core MVC, EF Core, SignalR, Google Fonts, Bootstrap and other API (Like TinyMCE, etc...) 

## üèÉ Getting Started

You can help me with designing the platform because I'm not a front-end guy so you can do it.

just open a pull request and I check it and then merge it into the project.

1. Go into directory where you plan on keeping project and run.
```
git fork https://github.com/wukalt/DevsMedia.git
```

2. Create database with nuget console / or locally on your machine
```
Update-Database
```
